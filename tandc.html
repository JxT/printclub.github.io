        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">1. DEFINITIONS</h4>
        <p>In this document the following words shall have the following meanings:</p>
        <p>1.1 &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; means these Terms and Conditions together with the terms of any applicable Service Specification.</p>
        <p>1.2 &ldquo;Customer&rdquo; means the organisation or person who purchases services from Supplier.</p>
        <p>1.3 &ldquo;Intellectual Property Rights&rdquo; means all patents, registered and unregistered designs, copyright, trade marks, know-how and all other forms of intellectual property wherever in the world enforceable.</p>
        <p>1.4 &ldquo;Service Specification&rdquo; means a statement of work, quotation or other similar document describing the services to be provided by the Supplier.</p> 
       
        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">2. GENERAL</h4>
        <p>2.1 These Terms and Conditions shall apply to all contracts for the supply of services by the Supplier to the Customer.</p>
        <p>2.2 Before the commencement of the services the Supplier shall submit to the Customer a Service Specification which shall specify the services to be performed and the fees payable. The Customer shall notify the Supplier immediately if the Customer does not agree with the contents of the Service Specification. All Service Specifications shall be subject to these Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p>2.3 The Supplier shall use all reasonable endeavours to complete the services within estimated time frames but time shall not be of the essence in the performance of any services.</p>                

        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">3. FEES AND PAYMENT</h4>
        <p>3.1 The fees for the performance of the services are as set out in the Service Specification. The Supplier shall invoice the Customer for the services.</p>
        <p>3.2 Invoiced amounts shall be due and payable within 30 days of receipt of invoice. The Supplier shall be entitled to charge interest on overdue invoices from the date when payment becomes due from day to day until the date of payment.</p>

        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">4. CUSTOMER&rsquo;S OBLIGATIONS</h4>
        <p>4.1 To enable the Supplier to perform its obligations under this Agreement the Customer shall:</p>
        <p>4.1.1 co-operate with the Supplier;</p>
        <p>4.1.2 provide the Supplier with any information reasonably required by the Supplier;</p>
        <p>4.1.3 obtain all necessary permissions and consents which may be required before the commencement of the services; and</p>
        <p>4.1.4 comply with such other requirements as may be set out in the Service Specification or otherwise agreed between the parties.</p>
        <p>4.2 The Customer shall be liable to compensate the Supplier for any expenses incurred by the Supplier as a result of the Customer&rsquo;s failure to comply with Clause 4.1.</p>
        <p>4.3 Without prejudice to any other rights to which the Supplier may be entitled, in the event that the Customer unlawfully terminates or cancels the services agreed to in the Service Specification, the Customer shall be required to pay to the Supplier as agreed damages and not as a penalty the full amount of any third party costs to which the Supplier has committed and in respect of cancellations on less than five working days&rsquo; written notice the full amount of the services contracted for as set out in the Service Specification, and the Customer agrees this is a genuine pre-estimate of the Supplier&rsquo;s losses in such a case. For the avoidance of doubt, the Customer&rsquo;s failure to comply with any obligations under Clause 4.1 shall be deemed to be a cancellation of the services and subject to the payment of the damages set out in this Clause.</p>
        <p>4.4 In the event that the Customer or any third party, not being a sub-contractor of the Supplier, shall omit or commit anything which prevents or delays the Supplier from undertaking or complying with any of its obligations under this Agreement, then the Supplier shall notify the Customer as soon as possible and:</p>
        <p>4.4.1 the Supplier shall have no liability in respect of any delay to the completion of any project;</p>
        <p>4.4.2 if applicable, the timetable for the project will be modified accordingly;</p>
        <p>4.4.3 the Supplier shall notify the Customer at the same time if it intends to make any claim for additional costs.</p>
        
        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">5. ALTERATIONS TO THE SERVICE SPECIFICATION</h4>
        <p>5.1 The parties may at any time mutually agree upon and execute new Service Specifications. Any alterations in the scope of services to be provided under this Agreement shall be set out in the Service Specification, which shall reflect the changed services and fees and any other terms agreed between the parties.</p>
        <p>5.2 The Customer may at any time request alterations to the Service Specification by notice in writing to the Supplier. On receipt of the request for alterations the Supplier shall, within 5 working days or such other period as may be agreed between the parties, advise the Customer by notice in writing of the effect of such alterations, if any, on the fees and any other terms already agreed between the parties.</p>
        <p>5.3 Where the Supplier gives written notice to the Customer agreeing to perform any alterations on terms different to those already agreed between the parties, the Customer shall, within 5 working days of receipt of such notice or such other period as may be agreed between the parties, advise the Supplier by notice in writing whether or not it wishes the alterations to proceed.</p>
        <p>5.4 Where the Supplier gives written notice to the Customer agreeing to perform alterations on terms different to those already agreed between the parties, and the Customer confirms in writing that it wishes the alterations to proceed on those terms, the Service Specification shall be amended to reflect such alterations and thereafter the Supplier shall perform this Agreement upon the basis of such amended terms.</p>        

        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">6. WARRANTY</h4>
        <p>6.1 The Supplier warrants that the services performed under this Agreement shall be performed using reasonable skill and care, and of a quality conforming to generally accepted industry standards and practices.</p>
        <p>6.2 Without prejudice to Clause 6.1, and except as expressly stated in this Agreement, all warranties whether express or implied, by operation of law or otherwise, are hereby excluded in relation to the services to be provided by the Supplier.</p>
       
        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">7. INDEMNIFICATION</h4>
        <p>The Customer shall indemnify the Supplier against all claims, costs and expenses which the Supplier may incur and which arise, directly or indirectly, from the Customer&rsquo;s breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement, including any claims brought against the Supplier alleging that any services provided by the Supplier in accordance with the Service Specification infringes a patent, copyright or trade secret or other similar right of a third party.</p>
       
        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>
        <p>8.1 Except in respect of death or personal injury due to negligence for which no limit applies, the entire liability of the Supplier to the Customer in respect of any claim whatsoever or breach of this Agreement, whether or not arising out of negligence, shall be limited to the fees paid by the Customer to which the claim relates.</p>        
        <p>8.2 In no event shall the Supplier be liable to the Customer for any loss of business, loss of opportunity or loss of profits or for any other indirect or consequential loss or damage whatsoever. This shall apply even where such a loss was reasonably foreseeable or the Supplier had been made aware of the possibility of the Customer incurring such a loss.</p>
        <p>8.3 Nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall exclude or limit the Supplier’s liability for death or personal injury resulting from the Supplier’s negligence or that of its employees, agents or sub-contractors.</p>

        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">9. TERMINATION</h4>
        <p>Either party may terminate this Agreement forthwith by notice in writing to the other if:</p>
        <p>9.1 the other party commits a material breach of this Agreement and, in the case of a breach capable of being remedied, fails to remedy it within 30 calendar days of being given written notice from the other party to do so;</p>
        <p>9.2 the other party commits a material breach of this Agreement, which cannot be remedied under any circumstances;</p>
        <p>9.3 the other party passes a resolution for winding up (other than for the purpose of solvent amalgamation or reconstruction), or a court of competent jurisdiction makes an order to that effect;</p>
        <p>9.4 the other party ceases to carry on its business or substantially the whole of its business; or</p>
        <p>9.5 the other party is declared insolvent, or convenes a meeting of or makes or proposes to make any arrangement or composition with its creditors; or a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, manager, trustee or similar officer is appointed over any of its assets.</p>

        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">10. QUALITY</h4>
        <p>10.1 The images of Products on our site are for illustrative purposes only.</p>
        <p>10.2 You accept that variations in colours are inherent within the printing process for files submitted. You also understand and accept that computer hardware set ups are such that we cannot guarantee that the Product colours will match those displayed on your computer screen during the ordering process.</p>
        <p>10.3 We cannot be held responsible or liable for colour variance on an order that has been printed with us, regardless of when it was printed. However, if you are not happy with the Product that you have received, we may at our discretion offer a reprint or a refund. We are not liable to offer both. Please contact us by telephone on 01323 430303 or email: <a href="mailto:sales@printclub30.co.uk" title="sales@printclub30.co.uk">sales@printclub30.co.uk</a> if you wish to discuss this further with us.</p>
        <p>10.4 For a folded leaflet and/or booklet, our tolerance is 1.5mm from the fold line.</p>
        <p>10.5 Please be aware there is also a 0.5mm off centre tolerance for trimming on some Products - for business cards, for example, the tolerance on trimming is 1mm.</p>

        <p>11.1 Unless there are exceptional circumstances, we aim to dispatch your Products for delivery within 5 working days. We do not offer international delivery at this time, but will update our website if we can offer this service in the future.</p>
        <p>11.2 Working days are Monday to Friday, excluding UK Bank Holidays.</p>
        <p>11.3 All Products will require signature upon delivery. If anyone other than the intended recipient signs for the Product and the Product is subsequently not delivered to the intended recipient, we will incur no liability provided that the Product was delivered to the address provided by you as part of your order.</p>
        <p>11.4 Delivery is complete once the Products have been unloaded at the address for delivery and signed for.
        <p>11.5 An individual part is classed as a stand-alone product that may be sold in packages (e.g. in 1000 letterheads an individual part is 1 letterhead). We use our best efforts to deliver all parts to you in one package, but from time to time we may be unable to do so. In that circumstance we will update you by email and will arrange for separate deliveries.</p>
        <p>11.6 Where delivery is delayed due to exceptional circumstances or a Force Majeure Event (please see section 14 below), we will process the delivery as soon as we reasonably can and will keep you updated regarding this by email. We will have no liability to you in that circumstance.</p>
        <p>11.7 Where delivery is not possible as a result of us being provided with the incorrect delivery address details, our delivery service will return the Products to us and we will hold these for 14 working days. We reserve the right to make an additional delivery charge for re-dispatch of the Products to the correct delivery address. If you have not contacted us regarding re-despatch within 14 working days, we may recycle the Products at our option and you will need to place a new order with us if the Products are still required.</p>        

        
        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">12. NON-DELIVERY</h4>

You should notify us by telephone on 01323 430303 or email: <a href="mailto:sales@printclub30.co.uk" title="sales@printclub30.co.uk">sales@printclub30.co.uk</a>.

        <p>13.2 We shall not be liable in respect of any claim unless we are notified in accordance with paragraph 13.1 except where you demonstrate to our reasonable satisfaction that it was not possible to comply with this requirement and your claim was made by you as soon as reasonably possible thereafter.</p>        

        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">14. FORCE MAJEURE</h4>
        <p>Neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure to perform any of its obligations if the delay or failure results from events or circumstances outside its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, strikes, lock outs, accidents, war, fire, the act or omission of government, highway authorities or any telecommunications carrier, operator or administration or other competent authority, or the delay or failure in manufacture, production, or supply by third parties of equipment or services, and the party shall be entitled to a reasonable extension of its obligations after notifying the other party of the nature and extent of such events.</p>
        
        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">15. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS</h4>

        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">16. ASSIGNMENT</h4>
        <p>The Customer shall not be entitled to assign its rights or obligations or delegate its duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Supplier.</p>
        
        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">17. SEVERABILITY</h4>
        <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason by any Court of competent jurisdiction such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the provisions herein shall continue in full force and effect as if this Agreement had been agreed with the invalid illegal or unenforceable provision eliminated.</p>
        
        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">18. WAIVER</h4>
        <p>The failure by either party to enforce at any time or for any period any one or more of the Terms and Conditions herein shall not be a waiver of them or of the right at any time subsequently to enforce all Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.</p>
        
        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">19. NOTICES</h4>
        <p>Any notice to be given by either party to the other may be served by email, fax, personal service or by post to the address of the other party given in the Service Specification or such other address as such party may from time to time have communicated to the other in writing, and if sent by email shall unless the contrary is proved be deemed to be received on the day it was sent, if sent by fax shall be deemed to be served on receipt of an error free transmission report, if given by letter shall be deemed to have been served at the time at which the letter was delivered personally or if sent by post shall be deemed to have been delivered in the ordinary course of post.</p>
        
        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">20. ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h4>
        <p>This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter and supersedes any previous agreements, arrangements, undertakings or proposals, oral or written. Unless expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, this Agreement may be varied only by a document signed by both parties.</p>
        
        <h4 class="pt-20" style="color:#333333; font-weight:200">21. NO THIRD PARTIES</h4>
        <p>Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, nor shall it confer any rights on a third party.</p>
